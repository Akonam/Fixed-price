This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
contract.sample <-read.csv(
  paste("data\\defense_contract_CSIScontractID_sample_15000_SumofObligatedAmount.csv",sep=""),
  header=TRUE, sep=",", dec=".", strip.white=TRUE, 
  na.strings=c("NULL","NA"),
  stringsAsFactors=FALSE
)
summary(contract.sample)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
